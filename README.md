# Mood Indicator

It's said that colors can affect Human Mood, lets build something like that.

In <code>App.js</code>, theres a div with id <code>mood-indicator</code>
and default background color set to <code>rgb(238, 241, 0)</code>.

Also there's a select element with Happy selected.

Each mood will have its color and whatever user selects in mood, its respective color will be set to
<code>mood-indicator</code> element as backgroundColor property in  styles.
<br/>
Happy   -> rgb(238, 241, 0)<br/>
Sad     -> rgb(19, 0, 164)<br/>
Sleepy  -> rgb(35, 177, 0)<br/>
Excited -> rgb(255, 0, 66)<br/>
